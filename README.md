# Test: Building a Naive Bayes Classifier

In this test, we will implement a naive Bayes classifier and use it classify Iris flower data.

Reference: [Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-classifier-scratch-python/) 

## Source code
The main source code is in [naive_bayes.py](naive_bayes.py)

## Train/Test Data

The data are stored in the [data](./data) folder. The labels are saved in the last column.

## Auto-grading

PyTest will be used to test your model. There are two test cases

1. `test_naive_bayes_model()` 

2. `test_naive_bayes_classifier`
